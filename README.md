# Boilerplate - Deco31416 

This boilerplate is designed for rapid integration and seamless connections within a web3 environment, making it ideal for developers, startups, and fintech companies aiming for quick MVP prototyping. With pre-configured integrations and comprehensive technical documentation, this template provides an efficient pathway for product integration, enabling swift validation and launch of projects.

## Project Structure

This boilerplate follows a modular project structure to facilitate scalability and maintainability. Below is a high-level overview:

- **public:** Public assets like images and icons.
- **src/components:** Contains reusable UI components, including the navbar, footer, modals, and UI elements like buttons.
- **src/pages:** Defines the main routes of the application using the page structure, allowing navigation and rendering of content based on the URL.
- **src/styles:** Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.
src/utils: Utility functions and helpers for various tasks.
public: Public assets like images and icons.
- **src/translations:** JSON files and configuration for managing multilingual content. This directory contains subfolders for each language (e.g., en, es) with translation files to provide language support.

This structure helps keep the code organized and makes it easy to add new features or expand existing ones.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Main framework for the application.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing to improve code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For custom styles and responsive design.
- **Headless UI**: For interactive components without default styles.
